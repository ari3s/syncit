#
# syncit config file for data update from Jira in Google spreadsheet
#
# Description
# -----------
#
# This is the configuration file for the synct script, used to update data from GitHub
# in a Google spreadsheet:
#
# https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zCMp1IUWoQB3JFe7FHbB2dmnFY6AzpJcZLXzJJuOoW0/
#
# This configuration file enables the retrieval of all bug issues related to the rpm
# package in RHEL from Jira. Authorized access to both Jira and Google Sheets is required,
# as the script uses their APIs. Replace the TOKEN configuration parameter with the
# name of your Jira token file.
#
# Examples of how to run the synct script with this configuration file
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 1. Run this command to check for any issues not yet included in the spreadsheet,
#    without making changes to the data:
#
#    synct -c synct_jira_example.yaml -n
#
# 2. Make a copy of the spreadsheet to have write permissions, and update the
#    SPREADSHEET_ID configuraion parameter with the value of your copy.
#    Use this command to update the spreadsheet with the most current data:
#
#    synct -c synct_jira_example.yaml -a

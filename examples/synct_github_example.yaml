# Description
# -----------
#
# This is the configuration file for the synct script, used to update data from GitHub
# in a Google spreadsheet:
#
# https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15xTRtrm6252viCE1nA-O4lCA_flk3SBlwJLZm2ipg-s/
#
# This configuration file enables the retrieval of all issues related to the synct
# script on GitHub. Authorized access to both GitHub and Google Sheets is required,
# as the script uses their APIs. Replace the TOKEN configuration parameter with the
# name of your GitHub token file.
#
# Examples of how to run the synct script with this configuration file
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 1. Run this command to check for any issues not yet included in the spreadsheet,
#    without making changes to the data:
#
#    synct -c synct_github_example.yaml -n
#
# 2. Make a copy of the spreadsheet to have write permissions, and update the
#    SPREADSHEET_ID configuraion parameter with the value of your copy.
#    Use this command to update the spreadsheet with the most current data:
#
#    synct -c synct_github_example.yaml -a
